# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course Constitution

## Core Principles

### Rule 1: Command-Driven Workflow
All changes, updates, and new additions must be created using SpecKitPlus commands. Manual editing should be avoided unless absolutely required.

### Rule 2: Code & Technology Standards
The textbook and its examples must use TypeScript as the primary coding language, with clean, typed, modern coding practices, and only approved tools necessary for the course.

### Rule 3: Simplicity & Relevance
No unnecessary sections, files, or content are allowed. Only include what contributes to Physical AI learning, Robotics understanding, and Software development clarity.

### Rule 4: Premium Quality Control
Every section must maintain Clarity, Accuracy, Professional structure, and Practical value.

### Rule 5: Flexible Expansion
Additional rules or sections may be added through `/sp.specify` folders or modules when required.

### Rule 6: Educational Focus
All content must prioritize educational value and learning outcomes for students studying Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.

## Course Purpose
This textbook serves as a premium, high-quality educational resource for teaching Physical AI, Humanoid Robotics, and their modern software foundations. It outlines what the book is about, what it aims to teach, and the technologies involved.

## Course Goals
The textbook aims to:
- Provide a premium, well-structured learning path for Physical AI.
- Introduce core concepts of humanoid robotics.
- Teach modern development practices using TypeScript, Next.js, and related ecosystems.
- Offer practical and conceptual knowledge without unnecessary complexity.
- Stay fully compatible with SpecKitPlus command-driven workflows.
- Serve as the official reference for the course's rules, workflow, and project expectations.

## Governance
This constitution ensures the project remains clean, premium, and aligned with both SpecKitPlus and modern TypeScript-based development workflows. All changes must follow the command-driven workflow and maintain premium quality standards.
