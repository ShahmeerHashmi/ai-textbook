# Gazebo & Unity

## Gazebo Simulation

Gazebo is a feature-rich 3D simulation environment for robotics. It provides:

- High-fidelity physics simulation
- Quality graphics rendering
- Multiple sensors support
- Interfaces for various robot platforms

### URDF/SDF

- **URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)**: XML format for representing robot models in ROS
- **SDF (Simulation Description Format)**: XML format for representing objects and environments in Gazebo

## Unity Visualization

Unity provides a powerful 3D visualization and simulation environment that can be used for:

- High-quality graphics rendering
- VR/AR applications
- Interactive simulation environments
- Real-time visualization of robot behavior

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you will:
- Create robot models using URDF/SDF
- Set up simulation environments in Gazebo
- Implement physics-based simulations
- Use Unity for advanced visualization
- Integrate simulation with real robot control
