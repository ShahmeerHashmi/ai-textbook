# Introduction

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to the integration of artificial intelligence with physical systems, enabling machines to perceive, reason, and act in the physical world. Unlike traditional AI that operates primarily in digital spaces, Physical AI systems interact directly with the physical environment through sensors, actuators, and robotic platforms.

## Embodied Intelligence

Embodied intelligence is a core principle of Physical AI, emphasizing that intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent and its environment. This approach recognizes that:

- The body and environment shape cognitive processes
- Physical interaction is essential for learning and adaptation
- Sensorimotor coordination is fundamental to intelligent behavior

## Why It Matters

Physical AI is revolutionizing robotics, automation, and human-computer interaction. It enables robots to operate in unstructured environments, adapt to changing conditions, and work safely alongside humans.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you will understand:
- The fundamental concepts of Physical AI
- How embodied intelligence differs from traditional AI
- The applications and implications of Physical AI
- The relationship between perception, action, and cognition in physical systems
