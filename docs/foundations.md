# Foundations of Physical AI

## Core Concepts

Physical AI builds upon several foundational concepts that distinguish it from traditional artificial intelligence:

- **Embodied Cognition**: Intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent and its environment
- **Sensorimotor Coordination**: Perception and action are tightly coupled
- **Morphological Computation**: The physical form contributes to computation and control
- **Affordance Perception**: Recognition of action possibilities in the environment

## Sensors Overview

Robotic systems rely on various sensors to perceive their environment:

### Proprioceptive Sensors
- Joint encoders for position feedback
- Force/torque sensors for interaction forces
- Inertial measurement units (IMUs) for orientation

### Exteroceptive Sensors
- Cameras for visual perception
- LiDAR for 3D environment mapping
- Tactile sensors for contact information
- Range sensors (ultrasonic, infrared)

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you will:
- Understand the core principles of Physical AI
- Recognize different types of sensors and their applications
- Appreciate the relationship between sensing and acting
- Be familiar with basic sensorimotor coordination principles
