# Edge Backend

## Overview

The Edge Backend architecture provides the computational infrastructure for running robotics applications on edge devices. This approach brings computation closer to the robot, reducing latency and enabling real-time decision making.

## Components

### Edge Computing Nodes
- NVIDIA Jetson platforms
- Real-time processing capabilities
- Power-efficient operation

### Communication Layer
- Low-latency communication protocols
- Data compression and optimization
- Failover and redundancy mechanisms

### Service Architecture
- Microservices for different robot functions
- Containerized deployment (Docker)
- Orchestration and management

## Benefits

- Reduced latency for real-time control
- Offline operation capability
- Bandwidth optimization
- Privacy and security

## Learning Objectives

- Design edge computing architectures for robotics
- Implement containerized robotics services
- Optimize for power and computation constraints
- Design communication protocols for edge robotics
