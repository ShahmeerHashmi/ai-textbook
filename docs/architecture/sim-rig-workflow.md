# Sim Rig Workflow

## Overview

The Simulation Rig Workflow defines the development and testing process that moves from simulation to real hardware. This approach allows for rapid prototyping and validation before deployment on physical robots.

## Components

### Simulation Environment
- Physics-based simulation (Gazebo, Isaac Sim)
- Sensor simulation with realistic noise models
- Environment and scenario generation

### Development Pipeline
- Algorithm development in simulation
- Performance validation and optimization
- Transfer learning techniques

### Hardware Integration
- Sim-to-real transfer protocols
- Domain randomization strategies
- Hardware-in-the-loop testing

## Benefits

- Reduced development time
- Safe testing environment
- Cost-effective validation
- Scalable testing scenarios

## Learning Objectives

- Design simulation environments that match real conditions
- Implement domain randomization techniques
- Validate algorithms in simulation before hardware deployment
- Optimize sim-to-real transfer
