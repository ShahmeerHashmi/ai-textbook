# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This course covers the fundamental concepts, technologies, and practical applications of physical artificial intelligence and humanoid robotics.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to the integration of artificial intelligence with physical systems, enabling machines to perceive, reason, and act in the physical world. Unlike traditional AI that operates primarily in digital spaces, Physical AI systems interact directly with the physical environment through sensors, actuators, and robotic platforms.

## Embodied Intelligence

Embodied intelligence is a core principle of Physical AI, emphasizing that intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent and its environment. This approach recognizes that:

- The body and environment shape cognitive processes
- Physical interaction is essential for learning and adaptation
- Sensorimotor coordination is fundamental to intelligent behavior

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Understand the principles of Physical AI and embodied intelligence
- Implement robotic systems using ROS 2
- Create simulations using Gazebo and Unity
- Work with NVIDIA Isaac for perception and manipulation
- Design humanoid robots with locomotion and balance
- Integrate conversational AI with robotic systems
