# Gazebo Project

## Description

Create and simulate a robot in Gazebo environment. This project will demonstrate your understanding of robot modeling, simulation, and physics-based control.

## Requirements

- Design a URDF model of a robot
- Create a Gazebo world for simulation
- Implement controllers for robot movement
- Test robot behavior in simulated environment
- Integrate with ROS 2 for control

## Learning Objectives

- Create detailed robot models using URDF
- Set up simulation environments in Gazebo
- Implement physics-based robot control
- Validate robot design through simulation

## Grading Criteria

- Model accuracy: 30%
- Simulation quality: 30%
- Control implementation: 25%
- Documentation: 15%

## Duration

2-3 weeks

## Project Steps

1. Design the robot model in URDF
2. Create Gazebo world and materials
3. Implement robot controllers
4. Test and validate the simulation
5. Document the process and results

## Submission Guidelines

- Submit URDF files and meshes
- Include Gazebo world files
- Provide launch files for simulation
- Document design decisions and results
